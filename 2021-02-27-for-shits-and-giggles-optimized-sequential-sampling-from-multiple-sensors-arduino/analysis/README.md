Generates a bunch of images in the same folder it is run.

# Run

We recommend running this using venv (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). The following should work:

```
>> python -m venv venv
>> source venv/bin/activate
>> pip install -r requirements.txt
>> python main.py
```

After running it, you should see a bunch of images in the same folder.
